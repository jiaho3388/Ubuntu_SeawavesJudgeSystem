Problem #10: Find the Two Largest and Two Smallest Numbers

Description:
Write a program that performs the following steps:
1. Prompt the user to enter an integer n to define an array of length n.
2. Prompt the user to enter n integers (separated by spaces) and store them in the array.
3. Write a function that takes the array as a parameter and prints the "two largest" and "two smallest" items in the array, separated by spaces.
4. If the array length is <= 4, output only the maximum and minimum values instead.

Example Input 1:
10
-1 2 -3 4 -5 6 -7 8 9 10

Example Output 1:
10 9 -5 -7

Example Input 2:
