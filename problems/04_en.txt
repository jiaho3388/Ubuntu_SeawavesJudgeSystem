Problem #04: Caesar Cipher

One of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, attributed to Julius Caesar. This method involves replacing each letter in a message with another letter that is a fixed number of positions later in the alphabet. (If the replacement goes past the letter Z, the cipher "wraps around" to the beginning of the alphabet. For instance, if each letter is replaced by the letter two positions after it, then Y would be replaced by A, and Z would be replaced by B.)

Write a program that encrypts a message using the Caesar cipher. The user will input the message to be encrypted and the shift amount (the number of positions by which letters should be shifted):

==============================================
Example Input1:
==============================================
Enter message to be encrypted: Go ahead, make my day.
Enter shift amount (1-25): 3
==============================================
Example Output1:
==============================================
Encrypted message: Jr dkhdg, pdnh pb gdb.
