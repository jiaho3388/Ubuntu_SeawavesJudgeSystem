Problem #12: Fibonacci Series Calculation

Description:
The Fibonacci numbers Fn are defined as follows:
F0 is 1, F1 is 1, and Fi+2 = Fi + Fi+1 (for i=0, 1, 2...).

In other words, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first few Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
Examples:
Fibonacci(0)=1;
Fibonacci(1)=1;
Fibonacci(2)=2;
Fibonacci(3)=3;

Write a program that inputs an integer n and outputs the Fibonacci number Fn.

Example Input:
5

Example Output:
8
