Problem #15: Classifying a Poker Hand

Description:
Each card in the hand has a suit and a rank.
- Suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades
- Ranks: two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace
- Jokers are not allowed, and aces are high.

After reading a hand of five cards, the program will classify the hand using the categories below.
If a hand falls into two or more categories, the program will choose the best one.

Categories (listed from best to worst):
- Type1: straight-flush (both a straight and a flush)
- Type2: four-of-a-kind (four cards of the same rank)
- Type3: full-house (a three-of-a-kind and a pair)
- Type4: flush (five cards of the same suit)
- Type5: straight (five cards with consecutive ranks)
- Type6: three-of-a-kind (three cards of the same rank)
- Type7: two-pairs
- Type8: pair (two cards of the same rank)
- Type9: high-card (any other hand)
- Type10: duplicate card (input contains identical cards)
- Type11: bad card (input format error)

Input Format:
Ranks and suits will be single letters (upper- or lower-case):
- Ranks: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t j q k a
- Suits: c d h s
- Input expects Rank followed by Suit (e.g., 2s, 8c).

Note:
1. Input card codes are case-insensitive.
2. The output string "Type" is case-sensitive (Capital T).
3. Do NOT print a newline character at the end of the output.

Example Input 1:
2s 5s 4s 3s 6s

Example Output 1:
Type1

Example Input 2:
8c as 8c 7c ad

Example Output 2:
Type10

Example Input 3:
6s d2 9c 4h ts

Example Output 3:
Type11
