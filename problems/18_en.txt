Problem #18: Array Reversal using Pointers (reverse3.c)

Description:
The reverse.c program of Chapter 8 reads 10 numbers, then writes the numbers in reverse order.
The original program (reverse1.c and reverse2.c) stores the numbers in an array, using subscripting to access elements of the array.

Write a new version, reverse3.c, that performs the following:
1. Reads 10 numbers into an array.
2. Writes the numbers in reverse order.
3. Constraint: Subscripting must be replaced with pointer arithmetic.

Example Input:
Enter 10 numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Example Output:
In reverse order: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
