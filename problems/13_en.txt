Problem #13: Guess the Number

Description:
Write a program that plays the game of "guess the secret number" as follows:

1. First: The program asks the user to enter a number as the "secret number" (range 1 to 1000).
2. Then: The player inputs a guess.
   - If the guess is incorrect, the program should loop until the player guesses correctly.
   - The program must provide the following feedback to help the player:
     - "Too-high": The guess is greater than the secret number.
     - "Too-low": The guess is smaller than the secret number.
     - "x": The guess is not in the range 1 ~ 1000.
3. When the user enters the correct number, show "Success".

Note:
1. Messages must be exactly as shown (case-sensitive): "Too-high", "Too-low", "Success", "x" (lowercase).
2. All output messages must be followed by a newline character.

Example Input:
50
2000
-200
30
80
60

Example Output:
x
