Problem #17: Find Max and Min using Pointers

Description:
Write a program that performs the following:

1. max_min() function:
   - Purpose: To find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
   - Prototype:
     void max_min(int a[], int n, int *max, int *min);
   - Function Action:
     When max_min() finds the largest element, it stores the value in the variable pointed to by max (assigning it to *max).
     It stores the smallest element in the variable pointed to by min (assigning it to *min).

2. Main program:
   - Read 10 numbers into an array.
   - Pass the array to the max_min() function (e.g., max_min(b, N, &big, &small);).
   - Print the results.

Example Input:
Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 7 94 23 11 50 31

Example Output:
